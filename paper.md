#Introduction
There once was a lady who had a garden gnome

She came out one day and gave her heart to the gnome as other people had done before her (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) demonstrated that when giving your heart to a garden gnome it is important to advice them on how to handle it.

Garden gnomes may not be reliable guardians of hearts. Therefore assessing incidence of heartbreak for garden gnomes is important.

# Methodology
We observed 13590 people with garden gnomes who have given them their harts. Observations were made following a previosly described methodology (Smith et al., 2002)

# Results
Around 90% of garden gnomes broke the heart that had been given to them. Around 50% of those who broke hearts tried to repair them. Around 30% managed to replaced them with false hearts. All garden gnomes who broke hearts were thrown out or discarded
