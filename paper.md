#Introduction
There once was a lady who had a garden gnome

She came out one day and gave her heart to the gnome as other people had done before her (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) demonstrated that when giving your heart to a garden gnome it is important to advice them on how to handle it.
